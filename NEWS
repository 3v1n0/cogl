  • List of changes since Clutter 1.6

    » Cogl split out into a standalone project!

    » Added native winsys backends for GLX, WGL, EGL and Android (Quartz in
      progress)
      » Supported EGL platforms include: NULL, X11, GDL and Wayland

    » Adds renderer,display,onscreen-template and swap-chain APIs for
      writing standalone apps using the experimental 2.0 API

    » Added convenience functions cogl_matrix_view_2d_in_frustum/perspective
      for setting up a Clutter style view transform for a 2d coordinate system
      inside a projective perspective.

    » Added an experimental Quaternion API

    » Added an experimental Euler API

    » Re-worked the CoglPipeline depth testing state API

    » Added EGL X11 texture-from-pixmap support.

    » Added a tiny Wayland compositor (without input support) under
      examples/

    » Optimizations:
      » Optimise paths that are just a rectangle
      » Journal: Use a pool of vertex-arrays to avoid allocation costs.
