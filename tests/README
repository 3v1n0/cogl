Outline of test categories:

The conform/ tests should be non-interactive unit-tests that verify a single
feature is behaving as documented. See conform/ADDING_NEW_TESTS for more
details.

The micro-bench/ tests should be focused performance test, ideally testing a
single metric. Please never forget that these tests are synthetic and if you
are using them then you understand what metric is being tested. They probably
don't reflect any real world application loads and the intention is that you
use these tests once you have already determined the crux of your problem and
need focused feedback that your changes are indeed improving matters. There is
no exit status requirements for these tests, but they should give clear
feedback as to their performance. If the framerate is the feedback metric, then
the test should forcibly enable FPS debugging.

The data/ directory contains optional data (like images) that can be
referenced by a test.

Other notes:

• All tests should ideally include a detailed description in the source
explaining exactly what the test is for, how the test was designed to work,
and possibly a rationale for the approach taken for testing.

• When running tests under Valgrind, you should follow the instructions
available here:

        http://live.gnome.org/Valgrind

and also use the suppression file available inside the data/ directory.
